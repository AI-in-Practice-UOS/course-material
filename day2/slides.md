# Disclaimer

<div style="padding-right: 10%">

- All topics of today are widely dicussed
- I will focus on things that are considered "best practice" among most devs
- If anything presented today is opinionated, I'll mark it as such
- I'm also just a Coxi student with some work experience under my belt. Hence, if you find any mistakes throughout this workshop, let me know :)
